# CWhy Supervised Learning Benchmark
## Intro
CSLB (CWhy Supervised Learning Benchmark) is my personal benchmark to measure perfomance of supervised learning.

## Non Goals
* make a unbiased benchmark for everyone
* measure computational resources of algorithms
* no-friction plugin of new networks
* unsupervised learning (maybe in the long future) or RL
* ImageNet-level large datasets that poor souls can't afford

## Final Goals
* measure supervised learning as my bias goes
* very handy to plugin anything Python by wrappers
* nice debug messages thoughout the whole experience
* utilize Python to its finest

## Current Goals
* quick and dirty version for anynet
* types are a must, no array type yet
* mnist/fashion mnist

## Short Term Goals
* cifar, tabular datasets from UCI and stuff
